# Water-Wall
A Tetris clone written in Python with Pygame.
Currently a work in progress so make an issue for any bugs you run in to :)

Make sure pygame is installed and run waterwall.py to play!

Help menu is currently in progress so: 
w/a/s/d or arrow keys to move the piece 
z/x or n/m to rotate piece 
space to hard drop 
escape to pause/unpause 
o to toggle music (in-game only for now, does not work on title screen or pause) 
p to toggle sound effects (in-game only for now, does not work on title screen or pause)
